# Optimal spending for standees in Mario Wonder

This is a simple program to run monte carlo simulations based on probability estimations for each standee tier.

Buying only random standees with repeats yields roughly 2100 draws to successfully pull all 144 standees. At 10 coins per draw, that's 21000 coins. Given that a guaranteed new standee costs 30 coins, we can estimate how many true random draws should be purchased before switching to guaranteed standees to optimize coin expenditure (To be calculated).
